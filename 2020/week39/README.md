## Notes  

Some highlights:

*  Used the `countrycode::` package to join country names on the UN regions and subregions.  
*  Used `anti_join()` to see what names weren't matching, and used `pull()` to print a vector of the country names that I could copy and paste.  

Further development:  

## Visualization  

**Original visualization**:

*  The world map clearly shows that this is concentrated in Africa, so a ranked bar chart is a simpler way to convey this that is much more memorable.  
*  I like how they show the disparity between boys and girls aged 18, but I think this could be edited to something that is also more memorable by limiting how many countries are shown and using a dumbell plot.
