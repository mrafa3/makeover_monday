## Visualization  

**Original visualization**:

*  The spike shows the relative magnitude of NYC well, but not much else.  
*  If you just look at the placement of the spikes, it does illustrate the concentration in California and on the east coast. However, I don't think that mapping this is very effective. Given that this is data on metro areas, there is going to be lots of unused space, and I don't think the map is the clear takeaway.
