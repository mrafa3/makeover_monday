## Notes  

Some highlights:


Further development:  


## Visualization  

*  Original visualization does not use color effectively. For instance, shades or blue are not related to one another. The number of colors is also well above what can be visually perceived.  
*  It also fails to use order in any meaningful way.
*  I like that the legend lines up with the start of each bar and that they show the percentages for each category.  
*  The polar coordination is aesthetically interesting, but doesn't lend anything to the analysis (or have any visual metaphor).  
*  I wonder if there might be any aggregation of categories that could make this more easy to digest.
